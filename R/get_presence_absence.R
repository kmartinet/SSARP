#' Create a presence-absence dataframe for a given occurrence record dataframe
#'
#' Use a dataframe output by `ssarp::find_areas()` to determine which species
#' occur on specific islands by creating a presence-absence dataframe. A 1
#' represents presence and a 0 represents absence.
#' @param occs The dataframe output by `ssarp::find_areas()`, or if using a
#' custom dataframe, ensure that it has the following named columns:
#' - "areas" containing the areas associated with the land masses of interest
#' - "specificEpithet" containing the names of the species living on those
#' islands
#' - "First" containing locality information. In the ssarp workflow, this
#' column contains the country name
#' - "Second" containing locality information. In the ssarp workflow, this
#' column contains a province or island name
#' - "Third" containing locality information. In the ssarp workflow, this
#' column contains the island name if the 7th column does not contain the
#' island name
#' @return A dataframe with a row for each island in the given occurrence
#' record dataframe and a column for each species. Within each species column,
#' a 1 represents the presence of that species on the island corresponding to
#' the given row, and a 0 represents the absence of that species on the island
#' corresponding to the given row.
