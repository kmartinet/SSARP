SSARP (Species-/Speciation-Area Relationship Projector) is an R package
that provides a suite of functions to help users **create speciation-
and species-area relationships for island-dwelling taxa** using
occurrence data from GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility)
accessed via GBIF’s API or the user’s own occurrence data.

Species- and speciation-area relationships are useful for determining
whether biodiversity is distributed in an unusual way in a given island
system (e.g., species richness decreasing as islands get larger instead
of increasing). An unusual trend in these relationships may be
indicative of habitat loss or a negative impact of non-native species.

Please find the [bioRxiv preprint of the manuscript associated with
*SSARP*
here!](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.31.630948v1)

## Installation

To install *SSARP*, use the “install_github” function from the
*devtools* package:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)

install_github("kmartinet/SSARP")
```

## Example: Creating a Species-Area Relationship

A species-area relationship (SAR) visualizes the relationship between
species richness (the number of species) and the area of the land mass
on which the species live. This brief example covers the *SSARP*
workflow for creating a SAR, and more detailed explanations of the code
and methods can be found [in the Articles on the SSARP pkgdown
website](https://kmartinet.github.io/SSARP/index.html).

In order to construct a species-area relationship with *SSARP*, we will:

- Gather occurrence data from GBIF
- Filter out invalid occurrence records
- Find areas of pertinent land masses
- Create a species-area relationship

#### Step 1: Gather occurrence data from GBIF

In this step, we will find the unique identifying key associated with a
taxon of interest (the lizard genus *Anolis* in this case) and use that
key to access occurrence points for that taxon from GBIF. We will
restrict the returned occurrence records to the Caribbean islands using
the “geometry” parameter in the “getData” function.

``` r
library(SSARP)

# Get the GBIF key for the Anolis genus
key <- getKey(query = "Anolis", rank = "genus")

# Print the key
key
#> [1] 8782549
```

The GBIF key for *Anolis* is 8782549. We will use this key, along with a
Well-Known Text (WKT) polygon around Caribbean islands, to get data for
*Anolis* from GBIF using the “getData” function from *SSARP*.

``` r

# Get data for Anolis from GBIF in a specified polygon around Caribbean islands
dat <- getData(key = key, limit = 10000,
  geometry = 'POLYGON((-84.8 23.9, -84.7 16.4, -65.2 13.9, -63.1 11.0, -56.9 15.5, -60.5 21.9, -79.3 27.8, -79.8 24.8, -84.8 23.9))')

# Print the first 5 lines of dat

```

The “dat” dataframe above includes the first 10,000 records from GBIF
for *Anolis* within a specified polygon around the Caribbean islands.

#### Step 2: Filter out invalid occurrence records

Now that we have a dataframe that includes the first 10,000 records for
*Anolis* within a specified polygon around the Caribbean islands, we
will filter that data to include only occurrence records that are on
land. Some occurrence records might have GPS points that are in the
ocean instead of on an island, so it is important to exclude these
invalid records.

``` r

# Find land mass names and exclude records not on land
land_dat <- findLand(occurrences = dat)

# Print first 5 lines of land_dat
head(land_dat, n = 5)
#>                                  SpeciesName  Genus      Species  Longitude
#> 1                Anolis distichus Cope, 1861 Anolis    distichus -69.010239
#> 2           Anolis evermanni Stejneger, 1904 Anolis    evermanni -66.314592
#> 3 Anolis cristatellus Duméril & Bibron, 1837 Anolis cristatellus -65.957558
#> 4       Anolis sagrei Duméril & Bibron, 1837 Anolis       sagrei -64.512895
#> 5      Anolis leachii Duméril & Bibron, 1837 Anolis      leachii -61.847698
#>    Latitude       First Second Third                           datasetKey

#> 2  18.29657 Puerto Rico   <NA>  <NA> 50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7
#> 3 18.396785 Puerto Rico   <NA>  <NA> 50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7

```

The “land_dat” dataframe above is a filtered version of the “dat”
dataframe that we created by gathering data from GBIF. The “land_dat”
dataframe includes occurrence records with GPS points that fall on a
land mass, along with the locality information for that land mass.

The locality information is split across three columns: “First,”
“Second,” and “Third.” The mapping utilities that *SSARP* uses sometimes
output different levels of specificity for locality information (up to
three different levels), so these columns provide space for these
different levels. The island name that we are interested in will be in
the last filled-in column of the three. For example, if there are two
columns of locality information for a given occurrence record, the
island name will be in the second. If there is only one column of
locality information, it will contain the island name (as with Puerto
Rico and Antigua above). If all columns have NA, the occurrence record
is invalid and will be filtered out in the next step.

#### Step 3: Find areas of pertinent land masses

Next, we will use the dataframe of occurrence records with their
associated land mass names (the “land_dat” object created above) with
the “findAreas” function to find the area of each land mass.

``` r

# Use the land mass names to get their areas
area_dat <- findAreas(occs = land_dat)

# Print the first 5 lines of area_dat
head(area_dat, n = 5)
#>                                  SpeciesName  Genus      Species  Longitude
#> 2           Anolis evermanni Stejneger, 1904 Anolis    evermanni -66.314592
#> 3 Anolis cristatellus Duméril & Bibron, 1837 Anolis cristatellus -65.957558
#> 5      Anolis leachii Duméril & Bibron, 1837 Anolis      leachii -61.847698
#> 6      Anolis leachii Duméril & Bibron, 1837 Anolis      leachii -61.845561
#> 7                  Anolis grahami Gray, 1845 Anolis      grahami -77.060327
#>    Latitude       First Second Third                           datasetKey
#> 2  18.29657 Puerto Rico   <NA>  <NA> 50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7
#> 3 18.396785 Puerto Rico   <NA>  <NA> 50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7
#> 5 17.118499     Antigua   <NA>  <NA> 50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7
#> 6 17.121707     Antigua   <NA>  <NA> 50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7
#> 7  18.39293     Jamaica   <NA>  <NA> 50c9509d-22c7-4a22-a47d-8c48425ef4a7
#>         areas
#> 2  9710687500
#> 3  9710687500
#> 5   301187500
#> 6   301187500
#> 7 12225750000
```

The “area_dat” dataframe includes records with GPS points that are
associated with a land mass, along with the areas of those land masses
(in m^2).

#### Step 4: Create the species-area relationship

Finally, we will generate the SAR using the “SARP” function. The “SARP”
function creates multiple regression objects with breakpoints up to the
user-specified “npsi” parameter. For example, if “npsi” is two, “SARP”
will generate regression objects with zero (linear regression), one, and
two breakpoints. The function will then return the regression object
with the lowest AIC score. The “npsi” parameter will be set to one in
this example. Note that if linear regression (zero breakpoints) is
better-supported than segmented regression with one breakpoint, the
linear regression will be returned instead.

``` r

SARP(occurrences = area_dat, npsi = 1)
```

This is the species-area relationship (SAR) for Anolis including
island-based occurrences within a polygon around Caribbean islands from
the first 10,000 records for the genus in GBIF! The best-fit model was a
segmented regression with one breakpoint. The R console will also output
statistical information about the model.

### Workflow Summary for using data from GBIF to create a species-area relationship plot

1.  Use `getKey(query, rank)` to find the unique identifying key
    associated with your taxon of interest.  
2.  Use `getData(key, limit, geometry)` with the key found in Step 1 to
    access *limit* occurrence points from GBIF. There is a hard limit of
    100,000 records for each call to `getData()`, as set by
    [*rgbif*](https://www.gbif.org/tool/81747/rgbif). The “geometry”
    parameter can be specified with a well-known text (WKT)
    representation of of geometry to restrict the geographic location of
    the returned occurrence records (see more about WKT below).
3.  Use `findLand(occ, fillgaps)` with the dataframe obtained in Step 2
    to figure out the names of landmasses using the occurrence record
    GPS points and the [*maps* R
    package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/index.html).
    Setting the “fillgaps” parameter to `TRUE` will enable the use of
    [Photon API](https://photon.komoot.io/) to fill in any missing
    landmass names left by the *maps* R package.
4.  Use `findAreas(occ, area_custom)` with the dataframe obtained in
    Step 3 to match the landmass names to a dataset that includes names
    of most islands on the planet and their areas. If the user would
    like to use a custom island area dataset instead of the built-in
    one, the “area_custom” parameter can be set to the name of the
    custom island area dataframe. 4a. If you’d like to only include
    occurrence records from islands, you can remove continental records
    by using `removeContinents(occ)` with the dataframe returned by
    `findAreas()`
5.  Use `SARP(occ, npsi)` with the dataframe obtained in Step 4 to
    create a species-area relationship plot that reports information
    important to the associated regression. The “npsi” parameter
    indicates the maximum number of breakpoints the user would like to
    compare for model selection. The returned model and plot correspond
    with the best-fit model.

### Workflow summary for using data from GBIF and a user-provided phylogenetic tree to create a speciation-area relationship plot

1.  Use `getKey(query, rank)` to find the unique identifying key
    associated with your taxon of interest.  
2.  Use `getData(key, limit, geometry)` with the key found in Step 1 to
    access *limit* occurrence points from GBIF. There is a hard limit of
    100,000 records for each call to `getData()`, as set by
    [*rgbif*](https://www.gbif.org/tool/81747/rgbif). The “geometry”
    parameter can be specified with a well-known text (WKT)
    representation of of geometry to restrict the geographic location of
    the returned occurrence records (see more about WKT below).
3.  Use `findLand(occ, fillgaps)` with the dataframe obtained in Step 2
    to figure out the names of landmasses using the occurrence record
    GPS points and the [*maps* R
    package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/index.html).
    Setting the “fillgaps” parameter to `TRUE` will enable the use of
    [Photon API](https://photon.komoot.io/) to fill in any missing
    landmass names left by the *maps* R package.

    Step 3 to match the landmass names to a dataset that includes names
    of most islands on the planet and their areas. If the user would
    like to use a custom island area dataset instead of the built-in
    one, the “area_custom” parameter can be set to the name of the
    custom island area dataframe. 4a. If you’d like to only include
    occurrence records from islands, you can remove continental records
    by using `removeContinents(occ)` with the dataframe returned by
    `findAreas()`
5.  Use either `speciationDR(tree, label_type, occ)` or
    `speciationMS(tree, label_type, occ)` with your own phylogenetic
    tree that corresponds with the taxa signified in previous steps, a
    classifier that describes your tip labels (whether the tip labels
    are simply species epithets or full scientific names), and the
    dataframe obtained in Step 4 to add tip speciation rates using the
    DR statistic (Jetz et al. 2012) or the lambda calculation for crown
    groups from Magallόn and Sanderson (2001) respectively to the
    occurrence dataframe. The user may also choose to estimate tip
    speciation rates from a BAMM analysis (Rabosky 2014) by using
    `speciationBAMM(label_type, occ, edata)` with a classifier that
    describes your tip labels (whether the tip labels are simply species
    epithets or full scientific names), the occurrence record dataframe
    obtained in Step 4, and a bammdata object generated by reading the
    event data file from a BAMM analysis with the *BAMMtools* package
    (Rabosky et al. 2014).
6.  Use `SpeARP(occ, npsi)` with the dataframe obtained in Step 5 to
    create a speciation-area relationship plot that reports information
    important to the associated regression. The “npsi” parameter
    indicates the maximum number of breakpoints the user would like to
    compare for model selection. The returned model and plot correspond
    with the best-fit model.

### Some helpful notes about well-known text (WKT) representation of geometry

When running `getData()`, the user can specify a well-known text (WKT)
representation of geometry to restrict the geographic location of the
returned occurrence records. The rgbif::occ_search function that
`getData()` calls requires a counter-clockwise winding order for WKT. I
find it helpful to think about WKT polygons in this way: imagine a
square around your geographic area of interest and pick one of the
corners as a starting point. The order of points in WKT format should
follow counter-clockwise from the corner you picked first, and the final
entry in the WKT string needs to be the same as the first entry.
Additionally, while GPS points are typically represented in “latitude,
longitude” format, WKT expects them in “longitude latitude” format with
commas separating the points rather than individual longitude and
latitude values. WKT polygons can have more specified points than
included in this simple square example, and even include polygons nested
within others or polygons with holes in the middle.
