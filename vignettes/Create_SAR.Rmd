## Introduction
A species-area relationship (SAR) visualizes the relationship between species richness (the number of species) and the area of the land mass on which the species live. The observation that species richness increases with increasing area is a fundamental law of ecology, and a disruption in this relationship may be associated with habitat loss, habitat fragmentation, and increasing numbers of non-native species. Creating SARs for island-dwelling species helps researchers understand how trends in biodiversity across archipelagos are changing due to these effects.

The goal of this vignette is to use the *SSARP* R package to create a SAR for *Anolis*, a well-studied genus of lizards. We will focus on *Anolis* occurrence records from the Caribbean Islands. More information about the *SSARP* package and a comparison to a previously published SAR for *Anolis* can be found [in the manuscript associated with the package](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.12.31.630948v1).

In order to construct a species-area relationship with *SSARP*, we will:

* Gather occurrence data from GBIF
* Filter out invalid occurrence records 
* Find areas of pertinent land masses
* Create a species-area relationship

## Gathering Occurrence Data
GBIF (Global Biodiversity Information Facility) provides an easy method for gathering occurrence data for taxa of interest. *SSARP* uses functions from the *rgbif* package to gather occurrence records associated with a given taxon. The user may also provide their own data for use in creating a SAR, but we will use GBIF in this example.

A tutorial for gathering occurrence records from GBIF can be found [in the "Get Occurrence Records from GBIF" vignette here](https://kmartinet.github.io/SSARP/articles/Get_Data.html). This example will use `rgbif::occ_search()` for simplicity, but please note that `rgbif::occ_download()` is more appropriate for gathering data used in research. Here, we will gather the first 10000 occurrence records for island-dwelling *Anolis* lizards in the Caribbean restricted by a WKT polygon (see the vignette linked above for more information).


``` r
library(rgbif)

query <- "Anolis"
rank <- "Genus"

suggestions <- rgbif::name_suggest(q = query, rank = rank)

key <- as.numeric(suggestions$data[1,1])

limit <- 10000

occurrences <- rgbif::occ_search(taxonKey = key, 
                                hasCoordinate = TRUE, 
                                limit = limit,
                                geometry = 'POLYGON((-84.8 23.9, -84.7 16.4, -65.2 13.9, -63.1 11.0, -56.9 15.5, -60.5 21.9, -79.3 27.8, -79.8 24.8, -84.8 23.9))')

dat <- occurrences$data
```

## Finding Land Mass Names and Areas
Once the occurrence data is returned, we will use each occurrence record’s GPS point to determine the land mass on which the species was found and find the area associated with that land mass using a database of island areas and names from *SSARP*.


``` r
library(SSARP)

# Find land mass names
land_dat <- SSARP::find_land(occurrences = dat)

# Print first 5 lines of land_dat
head(land_dat, n = 5)
```

```

```

The locality information is split across three columns: "First," "Second," and "Third." The mapping utilities that *SSARP* uses sometimes output different levels of specificity for locality information (up to three different levels), so these columns provide space for these different levels. The island name that we are interested in will be in the last filled-in column of the three. For example, if there are two columns of locality information for a given occurrence record, the island name will be in the second. If there is only one column of locality information, it will contain the island name (as with Puerto Rico and Antigua above). If all columns have `NA`, the occurrence record is invalid and will be filtered out in the next step.

Now that we have determined the names of the land masses associated with each occurrence record, we will find the area associated with each land mass.


``` r
# Use the land mass names to get their areas
area_dat <- SSARP::find_areas(occs = land_dat)

# Print first 5 lines of area_dat
head(area_dat, n = 5)
```

```

Now, our occurrence record dataframe includes records with GPS points that are associated with a land mass, along with the areas of those land masses (in m^2).

The `SSARP::remove_continents()` function removes any continental occurrence records, which is useful when the user is only interested in island-dwelling species (as we are in this example). While the data obtained by using the `SSARP::get_data()` function was geographically restricted, potential user error in specifying the polygon in WKT format often leads to accidental continental records that will be removed by using this function.


``` r
nocont_dat <- SSARP::remove_continents(occs = area_dat)
```

## Create Species-Area Relationship
Finally, we will generate the SAR using the `SSARP::create_SAR` function. The `SSARP::create_SAR()` function creates multiple regression objects with breakpoints up to the user-specified “npsi” parameter. For example, if “npsi” is two, `SSARP::create_SAR()` will generate regression objects with zero (linear regression), one, and two breakpoints. The function will then return the regression object with the lowest AIC score. The “npsi” parameter will be set to one in this example. Note that if linear regression (zero breakpoints) is better-supported than segmented regression with one breakpoint, the linear regression will be returned instead.


``` r
SSARP::create_SAR(occurrences = nocont_dat, npsi = 1)
```

The `SSARP::create_SAR()` function will also output the summary for the best-fit model for the data (displayed above).
