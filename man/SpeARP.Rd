\title{Create a speciation-area relationship plot}
\usage{
SpeARP(occurrences, npsi = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{occurrences}{The dataframe output by one of SSARP's speciation methods (speciationDR), or if using a custom dataframe, ensure that it has the following columns: areas, rate}

\item{npsi}{The maximum number of breakpoints to estimate for model selection.  Default: 1}
}
\value{
A list of 3 including: the summary output, the segmented regression object, and the aggregated dataframe used to create the plot
}
\description{
Use segmented regression to create a speciation-area relationship plot. The X axis represents log(island area) and the Y axis represents log(speciation rate)
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
key <- getKey(query = "Anolis", rank = "genus")
dat <- getData(key = key, limit = 100)
land <- findLand(occurrences = dat)
areas <- findAreas(occs = land)
occ_speciation <- speciationBAMM(label_type = "epithet", occurrences = areas, edata = edata)
seg <- SpeARP(occurrences = occ_speciation, npsi = 1, MS = FALSE)
summary <- seg[1]
}
